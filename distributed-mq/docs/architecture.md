# System Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the distributed messaging queue system.

## Overview

- **Producers**: Send messages to RabbitMQ exchanges.
- **RabbitMQ**: Routes messages via exchanges (direct, topic, fanout, headers).
- **Queue Manager**: Stores messages in SQLite (custom queuing).
- **Delivery System**: Distributes messages to consumers (custom delivery).
- **Consumers**: Process messages for pub-sub or work queue patterns.

## Components

(TBD: Add detailed architecture, diagrams, and trade-offs after implementation.)
